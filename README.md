The goal of the game is to deliver pizzas as fast as possible to get as many points as you can. You pick up the pizzas at the yellow pizza shop using the space bar and deliver the pizzas using the spacebar when you are next to the appropriate house. The map above the playing field shows which houses need pizzas. The white star shows your location. To move forward, you press the up arrow while facing in the direction you want to go.

This virtual reality game was made in Unity using C# and the Oculus Rift for Athena Hacks 2019.
